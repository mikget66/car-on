## A Personal Touch

CarOn is a project I built from the ground up, combining my passion for clean design and functional web development. The design is inspired by easital_tech's Liston design, which I reworked and enhanced to create a unique and modern look for CarOn. Every line of code was written with care, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for users.
