## üîÆ Future Plans  

CarOn is an evolving project, and I have exciting plans to take it further:  

- **Backend Development:** Currently, CarOn is a frontend-focused project, but I plan to **build a real backend** to support dynamic data management, user authentication, and database-driven listings.  
- **Tech Stack Exploration:** I aim to learn **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB** (or other backend technologies) to power the backend efficiently.  
- **User Authentication:** Implement secure login and user profiles for personalized car listings.  
- **Database Integration:** Store and manage car listings dynamically using a robust database solution.  
- **Admin Dashboard:** Enable easy management of listings, user accounts, and transactions.  
- **Real-Time Features:** Implement chat functionality for buyers and sellers to communicate within the platform.
